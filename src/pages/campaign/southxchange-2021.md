Based in Argentina, [SouthXchange](https://main.southxchange.com/) is a up-and-coming cryptocurrency exchange with a global user base. We have a great opportunity to get Ycash and Wry listed on SouthXchange, but we need your help.

SouthXchange uses voting to decide which coins to list. The voting is powered by SouthXchange's native exchange token, SouthXchange Coin (SXCC). There is a weekly contest, and the coin with the most votes wins a listing (minimum of 250,000 votes). Each vote consumes one SXCC, and a user can vote multiple times. (For example, a user can spend 1,000 SXCC and cast 1,000 votes for the coin of their choice.) Currently, SXCC trades at a price of less than 2 cents.

A small group of anonymous Ycash uers have generously pledge to match all votes cast for Ycash. In aggregate, these matching donors have pledged to match each vote cast for Ycash with **four additional votes**! Because of this generousity, if we raise a mere $1,000 to apply towards the voting process, we are very likely to win a listing.

Fellow Ycash users, I ask for your help. There are three ways you can contribute to this effort:

1. Open up a [SouthXchange](https://main.southxchange.com/) account, purchase a few SXCC, and use them to cast a few votes for Ycash. The voting site is here:

  [https://main.southxchange.com/Home/Vote](https://main.southxchange.com/Home/Vote)

2. Contribute funds to one of the coin addresses below. 100% of your contributions will go towards securing votes for Ycash (and any leftover funds will be used exclusively to support Ycash software development).

3. Contribute GPU hash power and mine Ycash to `s1gPv9oB7JEvo9DdBeiiYYCXNZCrmSHsDJs` at your favorite pool or mine Wry to `0x5173Ae5eBCf3963bF94b374C1221B765e0eA6e8d` at [daPool](https://dapool.io/coin/yec).

**Voting closes on Wednesday, June 2!**
