# Shielded Transactions

Shielded transactions are a core feature of Ycash. An ordinary bitcoin-style blockchain
transaction exposes the sender address, the recipient address, and the
transaction amount to the entire world. In contrast, a shielded blockchain transacton:

- does not expose the sender address to anyone, _not even the recipient_
- does not expose the recipient address to anyone
- does not expose the amount to anyone 

By using shielded transactions, you can enjoy some of the benefits of physical cash:

- You can pay a merchant without having to worry about increasing your risk of identity theft.
- You can transact with friends and family securely and safely, without exposing information
to outsiders.
